This repository contains all of the software for a dispensing machine that we have designed and fabricated. 

The code manages a Graphical User Interface, as well as parameters that can be directly added in by the user via the buttons and GUI. It's major purpose is to dispense the contents of the machine (for us it means Pills) at the right time (hence the use of an RTC and an alarm set up) and of the exact quantity needed. 

This code can be uploaded on an Arduino Mega and uses an LCD screen, 5 push buttons, a rotary encoder (with press option), 2 step Motors as well as a servo motor.
